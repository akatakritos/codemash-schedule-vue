This includes three very active cats, two adult kids; who are trying to figure out life in this crazy world, and a husband, who is most definitely my hero.  One of my gifts is - I have yet to find a kid I couldn't share a smile with!  Kidzmash attendee since it began and family attendee since year two of Codemash. Kidzmash staff for the last 5+ years. My philosophy – “Roll with it, there’s a reason for everything!”",

In this session, I will guide you through a simple drawing technique that will allow you to draw simple animals and their surroundings.  The only requirements are to have fun, must be able to hold a pencil/crayon and to follow simple directions."
