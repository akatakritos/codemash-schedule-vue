  "description": "Vue offers developers a way to build ambitious front-end applications with powerful reactive programming patterns and an intuitive HTML-based templating language.\n\nThis workshop will give you a jumping-off point for large front-end applications using Vue with blazing-fast dev tools like esbuild, rollup, and vite. You’ll learn the latest tools and patterns Vue offers for building reusable and testable UI code. You’ll get hands-on practice scaling an app to multiple pages using routing and state management libraries. At the end of this workshop, you’ll be ready to build complex and responsive front-end applications."
