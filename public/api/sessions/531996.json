  "description": "OpenTelemetry is the 'wave of the future' for observability, but is it ready for your team? Yes! In a few hours we'll instrument a demo application and see what OpenTelmetry can do. We'll also cover basic data filtering and compression, and how to see our first visualizations\n\n### OpenTelemetry\n\n* History\n* What's in the project - data backend, vizualization and queries are not part of OTel\n* Use cases - can help almost anyone\n* Status of development - Logs support is still growing, but you can send logs through the collector\n\n### Where to send data\n\n* Closed source SaaS backends\n* issues with OTel data being a 'second class citizen'\n* data in, but not data out\n* Prometheus/Grafana\n* Loki\n* SigNoz/ClickHouse\n\n### Collector Design\n\n* Most basic - direct from SDK to datastore, don't do this\n* Single collector\n* Collector -&gt; collector\n* Daemonset in Kubernetes (I promise you don't need to know Kubernetes to follow this talk!)\n\n### Sample Application\n\n* Basic data emitter from the CLI\n* Auto-instrumentation with the language-appropriate SDK\n* Configuring data sends\n* A basic dashboard\n\n### Configuring the Collector\n\n* YAML config\n* restarting the collector\n\n### OpenTelemetry Processors - config\n\n* batching - reducing sends\n* parsing - finding data early\n* crushing cardinality - getting the data you need\n* filtering - removing sensitive data\n* transforming with OTTL\n"
