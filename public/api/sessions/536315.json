  "description": "In today's digital landscape, APIs are an essential part of most software offerings, and from financial services to a Chuck Norris joke generator, all APIs have similar pain points.\n\n- How do we secure our APIs?\n- How do we monitor our APIs?\n- How do we authenticate and authorize users?\n- How can we rate limit users?\n- How do we scale our API?\n- How do we evovle our API?\n- How can we provide variations or client-targeted versions of our APIs?\n\nThe answer to these questions and more is API Gateways!\n\nIn this session, we'll explore API Gateways and the many benefits they provide. To do that, we'll implement an API Gateway using Spring Cloud Gateway, which is a fast, scalable, and open-source API Gateway written in Java, and demonstrate how it can help to level up your software."
