  "description": "This interactive talk about the weather is for anyone interested in the weather, open to all ages. In this session we’ll talk about the severe weather that Ohioans are most likely to encounter, and some we might encounter on vacations. We’ll talk about storm safety and the importance of being weather aware at home and when traveling. We’ll also talk about the public safety benefits of storm chasing and spotting.  We’ll discuss how to become a trained storm spotter and properly report weather events. We’ll watch storm chasing videos of mine and some of my friends while we create our very own tornadoes."
