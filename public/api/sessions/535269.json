  "description": "In today's digital world, many people with motor disabilities face barriers when accessing and using software due to their assistive device &amp; physical limitations. In this talk, we will discuss strategies and best practices for designing software that is accessible to people with motor disabilities.\n\nThe talk will start with an overview of the types of motor disabilities that can affect a person's ability to use software, including SMA, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, spinal cord injuries, and more.\n\nWe will cover the types of motor disabilities that can affect a person's ability to use software, the design principles and techniques for making software more accessible, testing strategies and tools, and real-world examples of software that has been designed and tested for accessibility.\n\nAttendees will leave with actionable takeaways that can be applied to their own software development processes to create software that is more inclusive and accessible to everyone."
