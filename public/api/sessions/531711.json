  "description": "My training as an Osteopathic Physician prepared me to counsel my patients about  injury and disease prevention. However, I did not realize the full impact of spending a majority of my time sitting at a desk would have on my overall movement and flexibility.\n\nIn this talk, I will provide background education on the most common injuries software engineers are at risk to develop and how I try to prevent these by implementing a few simple measures daily at work.\n\nSome of the measures include proper chair/desk/monitor adjustment, workspace setup, stretching routine that can be easily implemented at your desk and much more."
