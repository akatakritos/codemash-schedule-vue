  "description": "Your humble speaker has spent the last eighteen years devising, researching, and implementing ways to get kids into tech.  Between Scouting, advising friends, KidzMash, and my own Thing 1 and Thing 2, I have accumulated a rather dramatic list of ideas that do and do not work.  Programming, social networking, getting through COVID, gaming, hacking, and surviving the world today have all been implemented and tested. When I start the talk, you'll likely have a few questions about my sanity. When I have completed the talk, you will have a toolbox of new things to try - and maybe even a new attitude about kids and tech. I look forward to your joining me, and perhaps my Things, on a retrospective of our wild adventure.  I mean after an eighteen year sprint, I think it is time for a retrospective, don't you?"
