      "bio": "I’m a developer who advocates and evangelizes about interactive video streaming at Twitch. I’ve been writing code since 2004, and feel extremely lucky to be paid to do what I love and am truly passionate about. As part of my role as a Developer Advocate, I write lots of demos to show other developers how to use certain languages, frameworks, and technologies to solve the problems that they face every day. I have a background in writing and a love for theater, so I’m extra fortunate to have found a role that lets me use those skills and passions as part of my everyday routine. I’m married to my best friend and we live in the North Georgia mountains with our 2 kids, 8 chickens, 2 dogs, a cat, and a potbelly pig named Milton. When I’m not working, I love to cook, play video games and tinker with electronics and microcontrollers.",

  "description": "In this session, you'll see how I used an XBox controller, Arduino, a few servo motors and some HTML and JavaScript APIs to build the whole assembly. Even if you don't need your own PTZ rig, you'll still learn about some really cool JavaScript APIs like Web Serial, and the Gamepad API that you may not be aware of.\n\nIf you've ever been in the market for a webcam that supports pan, tilt and zoom (PTZ), you'll know that it's pretty difficult to find one for under $1000. That's just silly, when we have the technology and APIs to build our own for around 100 bucks!"
