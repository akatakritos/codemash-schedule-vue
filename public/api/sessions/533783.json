  "description": "Do you aspire to be an inventor one day? Maybe you have lots of ideas and don't know what to do with them.\n\nYou probably never heard of Frank Epperson, have you? But I bet you've heard of the popsicle, and he invented that when he was only 11 yrs old!\n\nYou may have heard of Ben Franklin, one America's \"founding fathers.\" He had a few other jobs as a writer, scientist, inventor, statesman, diplomat, printer, publisher, and political philosopher. But many don't know one of the coolest things he ever did was at age 11 when he invented swim flippers!\n\nIn this session, we will practice unlocking product thinking with the sharpest minds of all, kids.\n\nPractices discussed and exercised:\nProduct thinking\nProduct journey mapping\nExperimentation\nFeedback &amp; Iterating\n\nAlso, we will also play a game where we divide into at least two teams and bubble-sort ourselves to the finish line! Hopefully, we can get that done without any runtime exceptions."
