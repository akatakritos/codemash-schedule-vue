      "bio": "Seth spent 21 years as a professional developer/architect before finally joining the dark side of management. He now spends his days as a pointy-haired boss leading a small-but-mighty product development team in the search for elegant solutions to complex problems. He is passionate about clean architecture, testable systems, and bringing order to chaos. Seth lives in Columbus, OH and is an active participant in the Midwest developer community. He'll write TPS reports when he has to, but still enjoys writing, reviewing, and talking about code.",

  "description": "Modern \"smart\" homes are dumb; your lights shouldn't stop working because your Internet is down, and your new doorbell shouldn't compromise your network security.\n\nA smarter and more secure home doesn't depend on cloud services or a disparate array of apps to function, and it's easier than you might think to achieve total local control. A dash of technical knowledge, a dab of DIY elbow grease, and this session are all you need to get started.\n\nIn this session you'll learn how to choose and install a local hub (Home Assistant vs Hubitat vs HomeKit), which devices work best (Zigbee vs Z-Wave vs Wifi), and how to integrate lights, plugs, sensors, and switches without the cloud. You'll also learn how to add smart features like remote control and push notifications to your existing \"dumb\" appliances.\n\nCome take a tour through the land of smart, local home automation and stop being dependent on someone else's computers!"
