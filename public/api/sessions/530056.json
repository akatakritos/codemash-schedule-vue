  "description": "Today's solutions for cross platform development all aim to provide developers a better way to build their apps. Build your app in a certain way, and you can ship it to multiple targets (iOS, Android, Web, etc.) with ease. But not all solutions are created equal, and it can be difficult to understand the benefits of one solution over another.\n\nBut it doesn't have to be this way. In this talk we will look at some of the top cross platform technologies, see how they actually work, why you would use one solution, and why you should rethink your perception of what tool is \"the best\"."
