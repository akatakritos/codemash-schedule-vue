      "bio": "Jonathan, or J as he's known to friends, is a husband, a father, and the owner of Trailhead Technology Partners, a custom software consulting company with employees all around the world. He is also a Microsoft MVP in .NET and frequently speaks at software meetups and conferences. He doesn't mind too much because he loves sharing what heâ€™s learned, and it also gives him an excuse to visit any nearby National Parks, a passion of his, proven by the fact that he's currently made it to 52 of the 63 parks.\n \n J also has a passion for building community and has served on several non-profit boards over the years as a result. Currently, J sits on the SoftwareGR board, a non-profit trade organization dedicated to building the software industry in West Michigan. He also runs Beer City Code, a software conference, and has served as president on that board for over a decade. J loves hiking, reading, photography, and trying to see all the best picture nominees before the Oscars ceremony.",

  "description": "If you currently have a controller-based API built in ASP.NET or ASP.NET Core, you might be eager to embark on the journey of transitioning it to a Minimal API approach, but not know the best process to make it happen. If so, this talk is tailor-made for you.\n\nWe will delve into the advantages of using Minimal APIs, including the simplification of complexity and the boost in performance. We'll also go though a methodical, step-by-step migration process, complete with illuminating code examples so you can see the process in action.\n\nBy the end of this session, you'll be well-equipped to update any of your ASP.NET or ASP.NET Core APIs from controller-based code into the realm of sleek and effective Minimal APIs."
