  "description": "Web components have been around for a long time (since HTML 5 became a thing), but there hasn’t been a lot of attention given to them until recently. Now, tech organizations worldwide are adopting them and finding tremendous efficiency in creating framework-agnostic reusable components to build their Design System component libraries and applications.\n\nIn this workshop, we will learn about the important concepts around authoring web components as well as the technologies used to create, test, and distribute web component libraries for others to enjoy."
