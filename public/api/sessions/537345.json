  "description": "Salary negotiation is a daunting task, and it can be made all the more confusing, if you don’t understand the position management often has to take.  One of the best strategies for a successful negotiation is to determine what the other side values, and it’s not always the lowest number.  In this talk, we’ll answer the following:\n\nWhat constraints does an HR department put in place?\nWhat budgetary concerns do managers have to balance?\nHow does salary negotiation interact with development plans and job titles?\nHow does that change for small companies vs. large enterprises?\n\nThe answers to all of these will help you craft a better strategy for your next salary negotiation, from when to start it, to how to conduct it, and when to plan the next one.\n"
