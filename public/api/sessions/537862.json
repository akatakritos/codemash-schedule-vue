      "bio": "I am a W3C Invited Expert and Accessibility Advocate as an independent consultant since 1999. I have been a Senior Accessibility Engineer for the past 25 years with extensive front and back end development experience having designed, built, and maintained websites for small and large companies, remediating and auditing websites for WCAG compliance and part of many at the W3C whom are working on WCAG3. I co-host a podcast, the Front End Nerdery Podcast, and stream on Twitch. Originally from Portland, Maine, and now living in Phoenix, Arizona, I love food and cooking, especially lobster and lobster rolls. In some circles, I am the Lobster guy on Twitter, I wear the moniker with pride.",
