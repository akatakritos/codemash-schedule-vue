  "description": "What time is it? It's time to get creative and make an actual clock!\nIn this fun session every kid will be designing and creating their own clock. They get to plan and color the clock face any way they like. When they are done with the clock face, we will be adding a working clock movement to it. Every kid will leave with their own personalized working wall clock. All ages are welcome but younger kids may need help from parents. All supplies will be provided."
