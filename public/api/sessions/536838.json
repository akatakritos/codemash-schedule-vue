  "description": "The Enhance Fullstack Workshop is designed for developers. You will learn how to build a full-stack web application (client and server) using Enhance powered by Node.js, and AWS. You'll leave with the skills required to construct multi-page dynamic web apps that leverage the platform while avoiding so-called \"modern\" tools that layer on complexity and unnecessary weight.\nYou'll start by learning about Enhance's HTML first approach, how it works and what problems it helps you avoid. Then we'll proceed through several hands-on learning activities for building a modern web application complete with a UI built from web components, a serverless API layer, and a cloud-managed database."
