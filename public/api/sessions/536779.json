  "description": "The classic Windows Terminal app allowed for simple command line integrations. But now, the new Terminal app, along with the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), can generate some really cool interaction between you and multiple operating systems. Not only can you do command line, but the Linux X-Windows UI is live on the Windows platform as well. Cross-platform development, extensible code, native UIs and more can be realized when extending the full power of these features with other objects like Docker containers and K8's.  We will share tips, session files, settings files, and more!"
