  "description": "In today's rapidly evolving software landscape, Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are the linchpins of a streamlined and efficient development process. However, with myriad build platforms, technologies, and tooling, we often find ourselves entangled in complex build pipelines that require platform-specific tasks and scripts. Is there a way to untangle this web and create build processes that are not only reproducible but also portable across different environments? The answer lies in leveraging the extensibility of MSBuild.\n\nJoin us in this immersive session, where we delve into the powerful capabilities of MSBuild, the heart of .NET build. You will learn how to extend MSBuild with custom tasks and targets to replace complex PowerShell and Bash scripts or platform specific steps on GitHub Actions or Azure Pipelines. The session aims to empower you with the skills needed to:\n\nUnderstand the core concepts of MSBuild Tasks and Targets.\nExtend MSBuild to perform specialized tasks during your build process.\nCreate build configurations that are both reproducible and platform-agnostic.\nBy the end of this talk, you'll walk away with a toolkit for designing cleaner, simpler, and more efficient CI/CD pipelines that can run identically, whether you're building on a developer's machine or a hosted build agent.\n\nDitch those complex scripts and build steps, and come explore how MSBuild can simplify your build processes and make your CI/CD more robust and maintainable."
