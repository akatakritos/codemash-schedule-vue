  "description": "You have heard all the buzzwords such as microservices, event-driven architecture, serverless, etc. You probably have attended sessions that talk about these terms. But how do you put all that together?\n\nDuring this full-day workshop, you will start by designing a solution using serverless and event-driven cloud services using microservice patterns. Then you will build that solution using .NET, Azure services, and other best-practice tools. Finally, you will deploy that solution to the cloud so your customers can reap the rewards of a well-architected, reliable, and scalable solution that meets their needs today and provides for growth in the future."
