  "description": "We were drowning in bugs. We had countless partially implemented features. We had no tests, few types, no CI, no error handling, and we couldn't demo our work reliably. Developers kept copying anti-patterns in our code. Our software was out of control.\n\nIf you want to improve quality and velocity, this session is for you. In this session, I'll share techniques for rescuing software projects. I'll show how we rescued a failing project by incrementally implementing quality controls."
