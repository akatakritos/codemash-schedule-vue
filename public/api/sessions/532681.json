  "description": "So many software development teams rack up technical debt and do not even realize it.  But even if you are a more mature team and recognize and maybe even document technical debt, what good is it if you do not take action.  Just like in other parts of our life, just because we can accumulate bunches of debt, if we do not take steps to handle it, we will be destined for bad times when that comes due.  In this session, we’ll explore technical debt, how to properly document and track it, and – more importantly – how to address it so that it does not cause significant issues down the road."
