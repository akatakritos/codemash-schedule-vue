  "description": "Linux-based operating systems are at the very core of the magic of computing technology -- and have been that core for decades. But software developers, data engineers, cloud engineers, and so many other disciplines often have no idea how to work effectively within those operating systems. What happens when your code won't run? And how do you get things working again?\n\nIn this workshop, you'll be dropped head-first into a broken deployment machine, and you'll need to fix it, fast! This will be a fun &amp; lightly-competitive experience for all involved. Teams/individuals will be scored automatically based on how well (and how quickly) they are able to restore their machine to its former glory."
