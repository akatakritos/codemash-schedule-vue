  "description": "In the world of modern software development, microservices have emerged as the go-to solution for building scalable and deployable applications. However, the path to realizing their promised benefits can be riddled with challenges, leaving engineers with concerns about achieving a truly clean implementation.\n\nEnter Dapr. Learn how a sidecar architecture, using the Cloud Native Compute Foundation open-source project Dapr, can help improve your microservices with it's capability to codify microservice best practices and make them more portable by abstracting away your dependency on any particular platform component."
