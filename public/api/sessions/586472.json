  "description": "Want to make something more advanced than the ones you made in the basic overview? We have some additional options to expand model building skills for those who have been through our previous sessions.\n\nThis session the goal will be to build a raceable “matchbox/hot wheels scaled” 3d-printed race car. We will be using a variety of model techniques to produce a model car that resembles a real race car and then print it out on the lab’s advanced resin printers. While this session will repeat, the idea will be that attendees are welcome to come to both race league sessions and make different cars or continue working on tuning the model into a super car!\n\nOpen to anyone (kids or adults) who have gone through the regular introductory sessions. PLEASE NOTE this session assumes you have taken the basic overview classes OR are reasonably comfortable working in Rhino3D.\n\nThis session will run Wednesday and Thursday, after the adult session - 4-6pm.\n\nWe will have some track pieces at the lab to test and possibly race the cars once we get them built!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This is a session that is likely to have both kid and adult attendees. If your child has attended the introductory class and is looking for a chance to make something more complex, they are welcome in this class. It is likely best for High School aged teens or late junior high aged students, but any kid that has completed the introductory class without issue and is able to follow a slightly faster paced class may also attend.\n"
