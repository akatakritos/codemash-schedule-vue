Simple, hand-drawn illustrations are a compelling and fun way to engage, inform, and win your audience of readers and viewers!\n\nDrawing is a skill that anyone can learn. There's no such thing as \"bad\" art! You can make a huge impact with some fundamentals and practice, and have fun doing it!\n\nDrawing has become an essential part of everything I do. I would love to share my bag of tips and tricks I've learned to create illustrations for presentations, articles, videos, and more!"
