  "bio": "Damon Stamper was born to geekness by being named after the *nix daemon background processes. From there he played a \"toy making game\" where he'd design robots. He then got started in coding and building computers at the age of 8. It turns out tiny fingers are great for setting DIP voltage switches for CPUs! Damon currently works as a Senior DevOps consultant but enjoys gardening, coding, gaming (video and RPG), and electronics. He's still trying to figure out how to get the \"wet\" of gardening and electronics to play nice together!",
