  "bio": "With over a decade and a half of programming and working with data, I have a passion for anything related to the subject. If it has something to do with technology, I'm in.\n \n Beyond my professional realm, I'm a dad to a vibrant crew of young adventurers. Together, we seek out outdoor thrills, from skiing to biking, in my perpetual quest to earn the 'cool dad' badge.",
