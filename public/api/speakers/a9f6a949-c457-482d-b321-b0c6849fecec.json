  "bio": "I gained my Accessibility knowledge after a little over 3 years in the IT Department at the American Printing House for the Blind (APH) here in Louisville, KY. While there, I was always looking to provide accessible technology training, help implement more Accessible technology options, and learn everything I could to help others.\n \n Eventually, I moved on to more development oriented roles, including a QA role with GoodMaps, an accessible indoor navigation app developer born out of APH. Now, I work as an Accessibility Engineer with CVS. I hope to continue to build my career on Accessibility while also spreading what I learn to as many people as possible.",
