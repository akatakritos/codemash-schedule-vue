  "bio": "Dr. Michelle Smith’s unusual background gives her a fresh perspective on the tech industry and what it takes to build and keep great teams.  She is a veterinarian by education, and she still practices in the State of Ohio.  She’s also been an executive at a global software company and an active leader in her local community.  But her real passions are entrepreneurship and building successful organizations.  Along with her husband and business partner, Steve Smith, Michelle has built and sold several technology companies.  Michelle and her current team (which include several alumni from previous companies!) work with organizations to help them not only improve the quality of their code, but their overall teamwork.",
