  "bio": "Ever since Andrew was in kindergarten sitting in front of an Intellivision gaming console, he knew he wanted to get into the programming field to make video games.  He may not make video games now, but Andrew is a Software, Technical and Automation Engineer with over 18 years of professional IT experience building and architecting enterprise class multi-tenant environments.  He enjoys helping others and has a passion for automation and bringing people together to build communities around common technology interests.  He is also passionate about engaging younger generations in programming and technology, which has led him to become involved in teaching programming to inner city students.\n \n Outside of work, Andrew enjoys board/card games, hiking and camping.  He lives in Western New York with his wife and five kids, with hopes of getting back into video game development someday.",
