  "bio": "Mason is passionate about game development, but loves learning about all technologies, especially in the areas of code quality and software tooling.  Spending the early days of Covid teaching himself skills like Python and Unity3D, he quickly learned to appreciate and value self teaching. Now, while wrapping up a Computer Science degree, he is often diving into a new technology or taking a new online course alongside his school courses and projects. Mason always loves any chance he can to share his passions with others, be it family, friend or stranger.",
