  "bio": "I've worked in software development for 13 years (mostly Microsoft technologies) and love the problem solving aspect of the work. In recent years have become very passionate about AI and machine learning technologies and how they can be applied to different aspects of our lives. When not coding I enjoy spending time with my family, soccer (watching, playing and coaching), playing videogames and watching movies.",
