  "bio": "Randall's career can be politely summed up as \"interesting\".  He's worked at everything from tiny startups to Netflix to teaching introductory programming at a bootcamp (and wrote a book, to boot!).  Along the way, he's picked up insights that others on more traditional career paths tend to miss, and he'd like to share those insights with you.",
