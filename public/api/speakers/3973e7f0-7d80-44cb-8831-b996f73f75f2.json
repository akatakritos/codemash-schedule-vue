  "bio": "Tori Brenneison is a programming instructor, software dev, and former art historian whose purpose in life is to serve as a warning to others. When not teaching full-stack development to the rockstar career changers at Tech Elevator and doing her absolute best to promote diversity in the technology field, she can usually be found hiking, petting strange dogs, or admiring her collection of midcentury bakeware. Best to approach her in the wild with a sacrificial cup of coffee, and be forewarned: she's a hugger.",
