  "bio": "I’ve been doing software QA for seven years. I’ve seen a lot of weird problems, been traumatized by some of them, and now that people are asking me questions about what I know I can hopefully prevent someone else having the same problems I had. I did Ruby Cucumber for six of those, and I’ve been doing some C# automated testing in similar veins this year. I am familiar with automated testing and I can’t get away from manual testing no matter how hard I try – some of it isn’t worth automating. I will talk about that too.",
