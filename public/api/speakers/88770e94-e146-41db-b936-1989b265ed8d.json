  "bio": "Scott has a passion for helping people design, grow and automate their products and their lives so that they can focus on what's truly important and have a greater impact on this planet.\n \n By day, he coaches leaders and teams on product growth at Ford, by night he coaches IT professionals and entrepreneurs on income growth and career advancement, and on the weekends he has been known to perform laugh-out-loud stand-up comedy.\n \n Scott's dynamic presentation style delivers learning in many ways for many different types of learners, and he threads humor throughout his sessions to help drive every point home and make each one memorable. \n \n When he's not busy helping people level up their careers or helping teams and leaders build world-changing products, he can be found spending time with his wife, 11 year old daughter and 3 creative and rambunctious younger sons.\n \n They're probably building something out of Lego together.",
