  "bio": "Hi, I'm Marko Skugor and I love front end! I have over a decade of experience in the industry ranging from full stack development to specializing in design systems, accessibility, and frontend architecture. I've helped modernize applications across a wide variety of industries, and believe that investment in UX research is the most valuable choice any company can make. In my free time I like to hang out with my 3 cats and do nerd stuff in beautiful sunny Columbus, OH.",
