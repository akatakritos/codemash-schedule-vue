  "bio": "From cold calling to project management; car dealerships to welding joints; small companies and large companies, I’ve done a little bit of everything. Right now, I enable teams to deliver high quality software at CGI as a Project Manager and enjoy the challenge. When I’m not working, I’m giving baseball lessons, watching the Cincinnati Reds, or doing something outside. My beautiful wife also makes me try new things sometimes.",
