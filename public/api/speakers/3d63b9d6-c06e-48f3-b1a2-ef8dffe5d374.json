  "bio": "Andrea has over 10 years of experience within the management space. Her career path has certainly been a twisty one, to say the least. Starting off with a degree in English, she wound her way through technical writing in the manufacturing engineering industry, through to technical writing for a SaaS company, then a turn into change &amp; release management, eventually leading her to Engineering Management where she currently works within the Commerce Platform space at Stitch Fix. In her free time, Andrea likes to spend time playing board games with her family, attending theater productions with her daughter, and reading psychological thriller books that she swears donâ€™t keep her up at night.",
