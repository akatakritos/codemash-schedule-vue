  "bio": "After completing both a Java Full Stack Web Development and Data Analytics Bootcamp through Tech Talent South in 2019, I accepted a full-time position at CAS (Chemical Abstracts Service). \n \n Prior to working with CAS, I was an Internal Medicine Physician but I decided to make a change career to technology. I hold a degree in Osteopathic Medicine (DO)  from Ohio University Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine and a BA Biology with a Biomedical Science Concentration with a Chemistry Minor.\n \n In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my husband, Wes and our two parrots: Willie and Bob as well as bird watching, hiking, baking, volunteering and hockey. Let's go CBJ!",
