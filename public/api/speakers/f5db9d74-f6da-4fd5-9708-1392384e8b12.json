  "bio": "Meet Natalie, an impostor extraordinaire who came to banking infrastructure technology with a degree in linguistics and background in journalismâ€¦ and turned her temporary gig into a 15-year long career. Her experience spans four countries, five cities and two continents.  Throughout her career she has been mastering the the art of creating relationships with people and inspiring them to grow and be the best of themselves.  Natalie loves trying new things (skijoring is next). She is a world traveler, board game geek, an active mother of three+stepmother of two, and a proud owner of an imaginary cat. The things that make her happy are people and her insatiable passion for learning. She combines every interaction and every experience into a broad picture of WHY we do things the way we do and HOW we can use this knowledge to make our lives, and the world, better.",
